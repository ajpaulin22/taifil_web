                <h4>What is Technical Intern Training Program (TITP)?</h4>
                <p class="justify-content-center">TITP commenced in 1993 in Japan. The program aims to contribute to developing countries by accepting its people and transferring skills through On-the-job Training (OJT) in Japan. It promotes international cooperation through transfer of skills, techniques and knowledge gained by technical interns to the developing nations. This will not only contribute to the human resource development but will drive economic growth of the said regions.</p>

                    To amplify the impetus on making India the skill capital of the world, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), Government of India, has initiated several measures. One such noteworthy measure is the signing of the Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) with the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. The MoC was signed on October 17, 2017 to significantly expand the bilateral cooperation between India and Japan in the skill development sector. Under the program, selected candidates from India undergo three-to-five years of internship in Japan, after which they are required to return to India and utilize the skills acquired by them in Japan. In January 2018, MSDE appointed National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) to monitor the program.
